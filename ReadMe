# Image-Classification
The dataset used was from Zalando’s Fashion – MNIST containing 70,000 grayscale images of 10 types of clothing items. 
Utilzed TensorFlow and Keras to classify images in the dataset to help differentiate the 10 categories.​
- First attempt at a ML project with the help of Zalando's-MNIST research.
- Achieved an 88% accuracy score using a Sequential Model.
- Achieved a 90% accuracy score building a CNN model.
